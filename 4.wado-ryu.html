<p> Established in 1939 by Hironori Otsuka, Wado-Ryu is another Karate style that is one of the main types of this martial art. The term literally translates to ‘the way of harmony’ and there is a very strong emphasis on peacefulness and harmony of mind. The students of this style have to learn 15 kata and the stances tend to be mostly natural. This style of Karate is different from the other styles that involve powerful attacks. In this style, the practitioners seek to evade blows by learning to shift their bodies in order to avoid or reduce the impact of blows. Strikes are only incorporated as a counter-attack in this style. Jujitsu-style techniques are also a part of Wado-Ryu.</p>

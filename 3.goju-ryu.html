    <p>Goju-Ryu is a style of Karate that we are sure you have seen in action. If you have watched the movie ‘The Karate Kid’ you will have some idea of this Karate style. Based on the Okinawan Karate Styles that were already influenced by Kung Fu and Chinese martial arts, this style also has a very heavy influence from Fujian White Crane. There are only 12 kata in Goju-Ryu and the movements in this style are more circular. The stances are deep and natural. The literal meaning of Goju is hard-soft and this style is a mix of both hard and soft techniques. Goju-Ryu was founded by Chojun Miyagi around 1930.</p>
